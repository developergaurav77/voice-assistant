# voice-assistant
In this program, I tried to create a basic voice-assistant named "Junior" which can open different files/applications on computer, search on google, play youtube video, send mail on defined emailids, search and read things from wikipedia, take screenshort, can message on facebook on defined usernames and can open most of websites( facebook, messenger, github, instragram, reddit, etc).

following python packages are required to run this program:
1. pip install pyttsx3
2. pip install SpeechRecognition
3. pip install pyautogu
4. pip install wikipedia
5. pip install pywhatkit
6. pip install pyperclip
7. pip install pyjokes
8. pip install psutil
